Sam FleitmanDoyleHOD 2790 Data Science24 August 2014Proposed Research ProjectAvailable Data:The Whitburn Project“For the last ten years, obsessive record collectors in Usenet have been working on the Whitburn Project — a huge undertaking to preserve and share high-quality recordings of every popular song since the 1890s. To assist their efforts, they've created a spreadsheet of 37,000 songs and 112 columns of raw data, including each song's duration, beats-per-minute, songwriters, label, and week-by-week chart position. It's 25 megs of OCD, and it's awesome.”Musicbrainz - provides data on the relationships of songs
“The song The Rockafeller Skank by Fatboy Slim includes a sample from the Just Brothers song Sliced Tomato”Looking at the 100 most popular songs per year since 1890 (whitburn) and how many of these songs would later become sampled by artists in future years (musicbrainz), I aim to find which decade earns the title as the most sampled decade in music history and predict how many times popular music from 2000-2010 will be sampled compared to decades in the past. In doing so, answering whether our generation’s music is less or more apt to stand to the test of time than generations before.
